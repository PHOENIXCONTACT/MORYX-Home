# Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure a clean, consistent, and efficient workflow, all pull requests (PRs) must follow these guidelines:

**1. Consistency and Cleanliness**

- Every PR on `dev`, `future`, or `release/*` branches must be consistent with existing code and guidelines.  
- Do **not** reference PRs that have not yet been created for required changes.  
- The PR must comply with all defined coding standards, rules, and guidelines.

**2. Complete PR Fields**

- All PR fields must be filled, including:  
  - **Assignee**  
  - **Project**  
  - **Milestone**  
  - **Labels**  
- This ensures proper tracking, review, and integration.

**3. Use of Templates**

- Whenever possible, use the provided PR template.  
- Templates help standardize information, making reviews faster and more effective.

**Summary**

Following these rules ensures:
- Clear, traceable, and maintainable PRs  
- Faster code review and approval  
- Alignment with team and project standards
